This package provides a concatenated table of events recorded on
seasonal Transect cruises for Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological
Research (NES-LTER). Events were recorded onboard with Rolling Deck to
Repository (R2R) event logger (elog) software. Event listings include
date, time, ship's position, instrument, and action for use in physical
sample cataloging and post-cruise data integration. Cruises are seasonal and include
voyages dedicated to NES-LTER, spring and fall cruises through 2021
in collaboration with the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), and
additional fall cruises.
