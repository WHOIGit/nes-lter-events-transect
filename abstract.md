This package provides a concatenated table of events recorded on
seasonal Transect cruises for Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological
Research (NES-LTER) and other opportunistic cruises within the transect region. Events were recorded onboard with Rolling Deck to
Repository (R2R) event logger (elog) software. Event listings include
date, time, ship's position, instrument, and action for use in physical
sample cataloging and post-cruise data integration. Cruises are seasonal and include NES-LTER dedicated voyages, spring and fall cruises in collaboration with the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), and
additional opportunistic cruises.
