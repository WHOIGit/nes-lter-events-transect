This package provides a concatenated table of events recorded on
seasonal Transect cruises for Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological
Research (NES-LTER) and other opportunistic cruises within the transect region. Events were recorded onboard with Rolling Deck to
Repository (R2R) event logger (elog) software. Event listings include date, time, ship's position, instrument, and action for over the side operations, underway data collection, and other miscellaneous events during the cruise. The event log is used post-cruise in physical sample cataloging and data integration. Cruises are seasonal and include NES-LTER dedicated voyages, spring and fall cruises in collaboration with the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), and
additional opportunistic cruises.
